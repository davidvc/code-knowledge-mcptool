# Code Knowledge Tool Requirements

## Overview
A tool that manages and provides access to code knowledge through a local vector database and embedding engine, exposed as an MCP server.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Knowledge Source Support
- Must support storing knowledge from:
  - Memory bank files (markdown)
  - Code documentation
  - Project summaries
  - Design decisions
- Knowledge management should:
  - Support markdown formatting
  - Handle metadata
  - Enable updates and evolution
  - Maintain consistency

### 2. Local Infrastructure
- Vector Database:
  - Use ChromaDB as the vector database
  - Store in persistent repository location
  - Support efficient similarity search
  - Handle metadata storage
  
- Embedding Engine:
  - Use local Ollama service
  - Support configurable base URL
  - Maintain consistent embedding dimensions
  - Handle batch operations

### 3. MCP Server Integration
- Tool Registration:
  - Register as "code_knowledge_tool" MCP server
  - Expose multiple tools for different operations
  - Support resource access
  - Handle async operations

- Available Tools:
  - add_knowledge: Add new knowledge entries
  - search_knowledge: Search existing knowledge
  - get_context: Get relevant context for tasks
  - list_knowledge: List available entries
  - update_knowledge: Update existing entries

- Resource Access:
  - URI format: knowledge://{path}
  - Support reading knowledge entries
  - List available resources
  - Handle metadata

### 4. Performance Requirements
- Response time: < 3 seconds for typical operations
- Memory usage: < 500MB for typical usage
- Support knowledge bases up to 1GB in size
- Efficient batch operations

### 5. Error Handling
- Clear error messages for:
  - Invalid knowledge paths
  - Duplicate entries
  - Ollama service issues
  - Embedding generation failures
  - Vector database errors
  - Resource access failures

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- chromadb: For vector database operations
- modelcontextprotocol: For MCP server implementation
- Required Python version: 3.8+
- Ollama service: For embedding generation

### Storage
- Persistent storage for knowledge entries
- Vector database persistence
- Clean environment for testing
- Configurable storage location

### Configuration
- Storage directory configuration
- Ollama service URL configuration
- Support for environment variables
- MCP server settings

### Security
- Local file system access control
- Resource URI validation
- Input sanitization
- Error isolation

## Integration Requirements

### MCP Server
- Async operation support
- Standard tool registration
- Resource management
- Error reporting through MCP protocol

### Local Environment
- Ollama service must be running
- Sufficient disk space for storage
- Adequate memory for operations
- Clean test environment

## Testing Requirements

### Integration Testing
- MCP contract verification
- Tool functionality testing
- Resource access testing
- Error handling verification

### Package Testing
- Installation verification
- Dependency resolution
- Server initialization
- Basic functionality

### Test Environment
- Isolated storage directory
- Clean environment between tests
- Ollama service availability
- Resource cleanup

## Future Considerations
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Improved context retrieval
- Batch operations optimization
- Advanced metadata handling
- Caching mechanisms
