# Project Progress

## Completed
- Initial requirements analysis
- Language selection (Python)
- High-level architecture design
- Memory bank initialization

## In Progress
- Requirements documentation refinement
- Technical specification development
- System architecture detailing
- Testing infrastructure setup:
  - Integration test framework with real repositories
  - Response quality evaluation using LLMs
  - Test configuration management

## Not Started
- Development environment configuration
- Core implementation:
  - MCP server
  - Code parser
  - Embedding integration
  - Vector storage (initially transient; plan to add persistence)
  - Query handling and response generation
- CLI tool for indexing repository ("index_repository <path-to-repository>")
  - For now, only support a single repository; Python test disabled, only Java repo test enabled

## Future Enhancements
- **Multi-Repository Support**: Scale vector storage to handle multiple repositories by segregating embeddings into collections based on repository folder names. Detect duplicates and enforce unique identifiers.
- **Incremental Indexing**: Develop methods to update an existing repository index without fully rebuilding it.
- **Batch Processing**: Optimize embedding generation by grouping multiple code segments into single API calls, reducing load and latency.

## Known Issues
- Need to make integration test configuration flexible
- OpenRouter API key handling needs to be configurable
- Cleanup of temporary test artifacts needs implementation

## Testing Status
- Current focus on Java repository; Python repository tests are disabled for now
- Testing strategy defined in technical context
