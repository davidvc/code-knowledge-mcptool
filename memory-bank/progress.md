# Project Progress

## Completed
1. Initial Design
   - Memory bank architecture
   - Knowledge management
   - RAG-based retrieval
   - Update mechanisms

2. Embedding System
   - [x] Removed sentence-transformers dependency
   - [x] Simplified to Ollama-based embeddings
   - [x] Updated embedding implementation
   - [x] Streamlined dependencies

3. MCP SDK Integration
   - [x] Set up MCP SDK
   - [x] Created server structure
   - [x] Defined tool interfaces
   - [x] Implemented resource handlers

## In Progress
1. Integration Testing
   - [ ] MCP contract verification
   - [ ] Tool registration testing
   - [ ] Resource access testing
   - [ ] End-to-end workflow testing

2. Server Implementation
   - [ ] Contract compliance
   - [ ] Tool registration
   - [ ] Resource handling
   - [ ] Error management

3. Documentation
   - [ ] Update MCP integration guide
   - [ ] Document test setup
   - [ ] Server configuration guide
   - [ ] Testing documentation

## Upcoming
1. Test Implementation
   - Complete contract tests
   - Tool registration validation
   - Resource access verification
   - Error handling tests

2. System Integration
