# Project Progress

## Completed
- Initial requirements analysis
- Language selection (Python)
- High-level architecture design
- Memory bank initialization
- Development environment configuration
- Core implementation started:
  - Code parser
  - Vector storage (both transient and persistent)
  - CLI tool structure

## In Progress
- Performance optimization:
  - Switching from Ollama to sentence-transformers
  - Implementing batched embedding generation
  - Testing with large repositories
- Core implementation:
  - Embedding integration with sentence-transformers
  - Query handling and response generation
- Testing infrastructure:
  - Integration test framework with real repositories
  - Response quality evaluation using LLMs
  - Test configuration management

## Not Started
- MCP server implementation
- Incremental indexing support
- Multi-repository support
- Caching mechanisms

## Future Enhancements
- **Multi-Repository Support**: Scale vector storage to handle multiple repositories by segregating embeddings into collections based on repository folder names. Detect duplicates and enforce unique identifiers.
- **Incremental Indexing**: Develop methods to update an existing repository index without fully rebuilding it.
- **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance further.
- **Enhanced Query Capabilities**: Add more sophisticated query handling and response generation.

## Known Issues
- Need to make integration test configuration flexible
- OpenRouter API key handling needs to be configurable
- Cleanup of temporary test artifacts needs implementation
- Current embedding performance is slow with Ollama (being addressed with sentence-transformers switch)

## Testing Status
- Current focus on Java repository; Python repository tests are disabled for now
- Testing strategy defined in technical context
- Integration tests updated to handle persistent storage
- Performance benchmarking in progress
