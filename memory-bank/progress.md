# Project Progress

## Completed
- Initial requirements analysis
- Language selection (Python)
- High-level architecture design
- Memory bank initialization

## In Progress
- Requirements documentation refinement
- Technical specification development
- System architecture detailing
- Testing infrastructure setup:
  - Integration test framework with real repositories
  - Response quality evaluation using LLMs
  - Test configuration management

## Not Started
- Development environment configuration
- Core implementation:
  - MCP server
  - Code parser
  - Embedding integration
  - Vector storage
  - Query handling
  - Response generation

## Known Issues
- Need to make integration test configuration flexible
- OpenRouter API key handling needs to be configurable
- Cleanup of temporary test artifacts needs implementation

## Testing Status
- No tests implemented yet
- Testing strategy defined in technical context
