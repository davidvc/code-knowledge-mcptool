# Project Progress

## Completed
1. Initial Implementation
   - Basic code parsing
   - Text-based embeddings
   - Simple search functionality

2. Architecture Design
   - Two-phase processing design
   - Rate limiting strategy
   - Model abstraction layer
   - Batch processing system

## In Progress
1. Semantic Analysis System
   - [ ] CodeAnalyzer base class
   - [ ] OpenAI implementation
   - [ ] Rate limiting infrastructure
   - [ ] Batch processing with checkpoints

2. Configuration System
   - [ ] Model configuration
   - [ ] Rate limit settings
   - [ ] Batch processing parameters

## Upcoming
1. Enhanced Search
   - Update embedding system for semantic summaries
   - Integrate new search capabilities
   - Improve result relevance

2. Local Model Support
   - Implement LocalModelAnalyzer
   - Add model switching capability
   - Test with proprietary code

## Known Issues
1. Current embedding approach lacks semantic understanding
2. No rate limiting for API calls
3. No support for proprietary code
4. Limited batch processing capabilities

## Future Improvements
1. Advanced Code Analysis
   - Deeper code structure understanding
   - Cross-file relationship analysis
   - Language-specific optimizations

2. Performance Optimization
   - Caching of analysis results
   - Parallel processing where possible
   - Optimized batch sizes

3. Security Enhancements
   - Local model integration
   - Secure handling of proprietary code
   - Access control mechanisms

## Project Health
- Architecture: Strong, well-planned
- Implementation: In transition to new design
- Documentation: Up to date
- Testing: Needs expansion for new features
