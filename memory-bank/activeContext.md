# Active Context

## Current Focus
Enhancing the memory bank with dynamic features:

1. Knowledge Management
   - Supporting knowledge updates
   - RAG-based context retrieval
   - Specialized instructions
   - Efficient token usage

2. Update Mechanisms
   - Semantic change detection
   - User-requested re-evaluation
   - Consistency maintenance
   - History preservation

3. Context Optimization
   - Task-specific retrieval
