# Active Context

## Current Focus
Integration testing and MCP functionality:

1. Test Organization
   - Integration tests for MCP contract
   - Package build verification
   - Shared test fixtures and helpers
   - No unit tests (by design)

2. Test Strategy
   - Test functionality through MCP contract to enable easier refactoring. No unit tests.
   - Test MCP contract compliance
   - Verify installation process
   - Clean test environment between runs

3. Core Test Areas
   - Knowledge operations through MCP
   - Resource management
   - Tool registration and execution
   - Error handling
   - Storage persistence

## Recent Changes
- Consolidated test suite to focus on integration tests
- Removed outdated test implementations
- Enhanced package build verification
- Added MCP server verification
- Improved test organization

## Next Steps
1. Storage Implementation
   - Implement persistent storage
   - Add storage verification
   - Test data persistence
   - Document storage format

2. Documentation Updates
   - Update README
   - Document test strategy
   - Update installation guide
   - Document MCP usage

## Active Decisions
1. Integration test focus
2. Using Ollama for embeddings
3. Persistent knowledge storage
4. MCP-based interface
5. Clean test environment

## Current Challenges
1. Storage implementation
2. Test environment setup
3. Documentation updates
4. Installation verification
5. Error handling

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Create MCP contract tests
- [x] Setup test infrastructure
- [x] Implement test helpers
- [x] Add package verification
- [ ] Implement persistent storage
- [ ] Update documentation
