# Active Context

## Current Focus
Development of MCP SDK integration and testing:

1. MCP SDK Implementation
   - Building with MCP SDK
   - Server implementation
   - Tool and resource definitions
   - Contract verification

2. Testing Status
   - Integration tests in progress
   - MCP contract tests being developed
   - Test environment setup
   - Test coverage expansion

3. Next Steps
   - Complete MCP contract tests
   - Verify server implementation
   - Test tool registration
   - Validate resource access

## Recent Changes
- Started MCP SDK integration
- Created test infrastructure
- Implementing contract tests
- Setting up test environment
- Organizing test suite

## Active Decisions
1. Use MCP SDK for server implementation
2. Integration-first testing approach
3. Contract-based testing
4. Comprehensive test coverage
5. Clean test environment

## Current Challenges
1. MCP contract verification
2. Test environment setup
3. Server implementation
4. Tool registration testing
5. Resource access validation
