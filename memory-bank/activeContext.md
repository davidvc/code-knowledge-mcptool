# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial project setup and requirements definition for the Chat with Code Repository Tool.

## Recent Decisions
1. **Language Choice**: Python selected due to its robust ecosystem for ML/NLP tasks, rapid prototyping capabilities, and ease of integrating with embedding tools.
2. **Architecture Decisions**:
   - Local-only operation for simplicity and security.
   - Direct integration with the Ollama service for embeddings.
   - Abstracted vector storage interface, with an initial transient implementation and plans to add persistence.
   - MCP tool integration for Cline compatibility.
3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Integration testing using real-world codebases:
     - Flask for Python capabilities.
     - Commons Lang for Java capabilities (current focus).
   - Use of an abstract evaluator interface for response quality assessment via LLMs.
4. **Workflow Automation**:
   - Automated Git operations via the MCP tool:
     - Triggered by commands like "let’s check this in."
     - Standardized commit and push processes with automatic message generation.
     - Integrated success/failure reporting.

## In Progress
- Refinement of requirements documentation.
- Detailing system architecture.
- Development of technical specifications.

## Next Steps
1. Set up the overall project structure.
2. Implement core MCP server functionality.
3. Develop the code parsing system.
4. Integrate with Ollama for generating embeddings, including implementing batch processing of code segments to optimize embedding generation.
5. Implement an initial transient vector storage.
6. Add query handling and response generation.
7. Develop the CLI tool for indexing the repository ("index_repository <path-to-repository>") for the single repository scenario.

## Future Plans
- **Multi-Repository Support**: Expand the system to handle multiple repositories by assigning unique collections based on each repository’s folder name; enforce uniqueness and detect duplicates.
- **Incremental Indexing**: Create mechanisms to update an existing repository index without fully rebuilding it, making the indexing process more efficient when only small changes occur.
