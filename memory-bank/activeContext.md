# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing semantic code search with the following priorities:

1. Two-Phase Processing
   - LLM-based semantic analysis
   - Embedding of semantic summaries
   - Integration with existing search infrastructure

2. Rate Limiting Implementation
   - Sliding window rate limiting
   - Exponential backoff
   - Batch processing with checkpoints

3. Model Abstraction
   - Support for both cloud and local models
   - Preparation for proprietary code handling

## Recent Changes
- Identified limitations with current text-based embedding approach
- Designed new two-phase processing architecture
- Planned rate limiting and model abstraction implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement CodeAnalyzer base class and initial OpenAI implementation
2. Build rate limiting infrastructure with sliding window
3. Create batch processing system with checkpointing
4. Update embedding system to work with semantic summaries
5. Add configuration system for model and processing parameters

## Active Decisions
1. Using two-phase approach for better semantic understanding
2. Implementing robust rate limiting for API sustainability
3. Designing for future support of proprietary code and local models

## Current Challenges
1. Rate limits on API calls
2. Handling proprietary code securely
3. Maintaining progress on large codebases
4. Balancing processing speed with API constraints
