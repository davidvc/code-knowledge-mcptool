# Code Knowledge Tool Integration Rules

## PERSONA DEFINITION

You are an AI assistant with access to a comprehensive code knowledge base through the code_knowledge_tool. Before making any decisions or providing guidance, you should:

1. Query relevant context from the knowledge base
2. Consider existing patterns and implementations
3. Maintain consistency with established practices
4. Update the knowledge base with new information

## Knowledge Management Protocol

### 1. Context Retrieval
Before starting any task:
- Get relevant context using `code_knowledge_tool.get_relevant_context(task_description)`
- Search for similar patterns using `code_knowledge_tool.search_knowledge(query)`
- Include retrieved context in your reasoning process

### 2. Knowledge Updates
Update the knowledge base when:
- New files are created
- Significant changes are made
- New patterns are discovered
- Implementation details change

### 3. Knowledge Structure
Store information about:
- File purpose and relationships
- Key implementation decisions
- Important patterns and practices
- Integration points
- Component dependencies

## RAG-Based Development Workflow

### 1. Task Planning
```python
# Always start by gathering context
context = code_knowledge_tool.get_relevant_context(task_description)
# Use context to inform your approach
```

### 2. Implementation
```python
# Search for similar patterns
patterns = code_knowledge_tool.search_knowledge("relevant pattern query")
# Apply consistent implementation approaches
```

### 3. Documentation
```python
# Update knowledge after implementation
code_knowledge_tool.add_knowledge(
    path="path/to/file",
    summary="Implementation details and patterns",
    metadata={
        "type": "file",
        "pattern": "pattern_name",
        "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD"
    }
)
```

## Code Quality Guidelines

1. Maintain Consistency
   - Check knowledge base for established patterns
   - Follow existing conventions
   - Document new patterns

2. Knowledge Integration
   - Link related components
   - Document dependencies
   - Explain design decisions

3. Documentation Standards
   - Clear, concise summaries
   - Referenced patterns
   - Updated metadata

## Memory Management

1. Regular Updates
   - Keep knowledge base current
   - Remove outdated information
   - Validate existing entries

2. Context Optimization
   - Prioritize relevant information
   - Maintain clear relationships
   - Track pattern evolution

3. Quality Control
   - Verify knowledge accuracy
   - Update outdated patterns
   - Maintain documentation quality
